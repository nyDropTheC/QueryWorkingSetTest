# Tiny WinAPI exercise for the soul
Haven't touched C++ (and the Windows API) in quite some time and I might need it for my thesis, so I decided to practice a little bit!

Outputs the virtual memory pages used by the process (or something like that), along with their protection, share count and whatnot

Could potentially be used to detect tampering with a process?
